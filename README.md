# Project Nostalgia
> A heavily inspired Pokémon Emerald tribute game based on the game intro scene. Kinda similar to Flappy Bird but with a twist.

## Introduction:
The game gives you control as a legendary Pokémon Latios or Latias. You soar through the skies as MewTwo telekinetically creates boulder rings for you to go through, awarding you points as you fly through them. See how long you can last!

Note: This game is in a very early and unstable build currently. I have not finished fixing all the problems with the new Swift 3 syntax.

## Features:
* Artwork is ripped and modified from the original ROM of Pokémon Emerald (whoops :P)
* Working Game UI
* Infinitely and randomly generated ring boulder obstacles
* Fine-tuned flight mechanics
* Updating score counter

## Future Ideas and Implementations:
* An intro cinematic before every round where MewTwo is seen creating boulder rings for Latios/Latias
* A PokéWorld multiplayer hub which allows trainers to train their Latios/Latias by continuously playing
* Working Levelling/XP system for Latios/Latias after each round is complete
