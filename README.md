Project Nostalgia
===============

This project tries to recreate the Pokémon Emerald introduction scene and turn it into an iOS arcade style game. All artwork is ripped directly from the Pokémon Emerald ROM and is therefore impossible for the app to make it to the Appstore (without a cease and desist letter from Nintendo).

# Introduction
The game gives you control as a legendary Pokémon Latios or Latias. You soar through the skies as MewTwo telekinetically creates boulder rings for you to go through, awarding you points as you fly through them. See how long you can last!

# Features
* Artwork is ripped and modified from the original ROM of Pokémon Emerald (whoops :P)
* Working Game UI
* Infinitely and randomly generated ring boulder obstacles
* Fine-tuned flight mechanics
* Updating score counter
* Very realistic collision mechanics
* SpriteKit system

# Future Ideas and Implementations
* An intro cinematic before every round where MewTwo is seen creating boulder rings for Latios/Latias
* A PokéWorld multiplayer hub which allows trainers to train their Latios/Latias by continuously playing
* Working Levelling/XP system for Latios/Latias after each round is complete

# Demo
